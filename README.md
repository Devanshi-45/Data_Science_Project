This study explores the effectiveness of deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning with VGG-16, for classifying plant diseases using leaf images. Using the PlantVillage dataset with around 87,000 images across 38 categories, the research aims to evaluate the impact of data augmentation and image preprocessing on model accuracy, and to compare a custom CNN with the VGG-16 Transfer Learning model. The findings show that VGG-16 significantly outperforms the custom CNN in accuracy and generalization. This research seeks to improve precision agriculture by offering a scalable solution for early disease detection, thus enhancing crop yield and food security while highlighting the role of advanced machine learning in sustainable farming.
This project focuses on building a robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify plant diseases using an extensive dataset of plant leaf images. By employing various data augmentation techniques and optimizing the architecture of the CNN, the model aims to accurately identify 38 different plant diseases. The model is designed to process images at a 150x150 resolution, and features layers of convolution, max-pooling, and global average pooling, combined with dense layers to extract and classify features effectively. Through strategic use of batch normalization, dropout, and an adaptive learning rate, the project seeks to improve training efficiency and model accuracy while ensuring no epochs are skipped and each epoch runs for a sufficient duration.

The project's primary objective is to develop a practical tool that can assist in the early detection of plant diseases, which is crucial for maintaining healthy crops and improving agricultural productivity. By implementing a CNN model tailored for high accuracy and stability during training, this work contributes to the growing field of AI-driven solutions in agriculture, potentially providing farmers with a reliable method for disease identification and management.
