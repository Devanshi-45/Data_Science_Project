Hi, This is project using Deep Learning for classification of diseases using leaf images
Here I have used both CNN and Transfer Learning Models And compared their results.

This study explores the effectiveness of deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning with VGG-16, for classifying plant diseases using leaf images. Using the PlantVillage dataset with around 87,000 images across 38 categories, the research aims to evaluate the impact of data augmentation and image preprocessing on model accuracy, and to compare a custom CNN with the VGG-16 Transfer Learning model. The findings show that VGG-16 significantly outperforms the custom CNN in accuracy and generalization. This research seeks to improve precision agriculture by offering a scalable solution for early disease detection, thus enhancing crop yield and food security while highlighting the role of advanced machine learning in sustainable farming.
